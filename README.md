Hello, This code acts as a proxyy opening a small browser that allows people to play games whilst fooling lightspeed into believing that it is connecting
a student to schoology or any other website. In reality the student is able to play games undetected and is not putting the user in any danger or at risk
from using the program, This allows for a connection that allows people to play games and give students the choice. 

The reason this program is able to do this is because it spoofs a few things of which you would probably have to look in the code because I am lazy.

Thanks for spending your time reading something that will have such an insignificant impact on  your life that it is useless.
